# Open Source Polkadot Stack [WIP!]

The goal of this page is to provide an overview of the open-source Polkadot/Kusama Tech Stack. At the moment it's a work-in-progress.

## :clipboard: About 

The Polkadot Tech Stack is a subset of the Web 3.0 Tech Stack, which consists of the **open-source** technologies contributing to and relying on [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), [Kusama](https://kusama.network/) and [Substrate](https://substrate.dev/). It is meant to be used for decentralized application (Dapp) development within many possible verticals including DeFi, Gaming, Provenance and many others not pictured below.

## :battery: Funding

The Web3 Foundation's [General Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/grants.md) 
and [Open Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program) are focused on funding development work to build out all layers of the Polkadot Tech Stack. Please use the preceding links to apply for funding for relevant projects.

To get a better understanding of the projects we consider most relevant you can explore a detailed breakdown of the various layers of stack, below. We divide each of the layers into the various *components* which we feel are most important. We then highlight some of the *exisiting projects* that address these components as well as some *potentially interesting projects* that we would like to fund.

We typically like to fund more than one project for each component so if you see a component with 1 or 0 exisiting projects then it's likely that we would consider an application in this area. In order to consider funding a proposal that addresses a component with many existing projects then we would need to be persuaded that this proposal brought unique value to the ecosystem. Such value could be in many forms including but not limited to differentiated functionality, better user experience, the attraction of new users to the ecosystem or a high-likelihood that the technology would be maintained for a long period of time.

By describing our areas of priority in detail we do not wish to preclude grant applications that address different areas that we may not have thought of. We would like to fund all projects that bring value to the ecosystem. If you are considering applying for a project and are not sure if it falls within our areas of interest then please get in touch with us to discuss it.

## :construction_worker: Contributing

Pull requests, issues, or other contributions from the community are encouraged!  You can not only add specific projects but also potentially interesting fields/areas, which are currently missing in the tech stack. 

:heavy_exclamation_mark: All technologies listed above need to be open-source. Ideally, the links lead directly to the code. 

_Note: You will need a GitHub account to suggest changes or file issues. If you do not have a GitHub account, you may [sign up for one for free](https://github.com/join)._
